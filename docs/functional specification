This model is used for simulating Turing pattern by reaction diffusion model.

A Turing pattern is a spatially organized, stable pattern that emerges from the interaction between two or more chemical species undergoing reaction and diffusion. It was first described by Alan Turing in his 1952 paper on morphogenesis. The system typically involves an activator and an inhibitor, where:
1. Activator promotes both its own production and that of the inhibitor.
2. Inhibitor suppresses the activator's production.
3. Diffusion plays a key role: the inhibitor diffuses faster than the activator, leading to localized concentrations of the activator.
Mathematically, Turing patterns emerge when specific parameter conditions cause the homogeneous steady state of the reaction-diffusion system to become unstable, giving rise to periodic spatial patterns.

The Turing model appears in chemical reactions, in the formation and development of biological forms. Understanding the Turing model is important for understanding biomolecular interactions, biological development, the construction of self-forming systems, and systems biology.

Users

1. Biologist - in morphogenesis, development, ecology and pattern formation. By adjusting the parameters of the model, they can simulate different biological patterns to better understand the formation mechanism of zebra stripes, spots, fish scales, bacteria population and other patterns.
2. Materials chemist - learn patterns formed in different materials or chemical environments to provide guidance for material design and chemical reactions
3. Computational and system biologist - learn basic parameters in pattern formation and how to form a specific pattern as nature.
4. Artist - generate nature-inspired design from a Turing pattern


what information users want from the system 

1. Visual Representation of Patterns: Users want to see the Turing patterns generated from specific reaction-diffusion parameters. They expect the tool to provide clear and accurate visualizations of the spatial patterns based on their inputs.
2. Parameter Sweep and Pattern Exploration Results: For exploring a range of parameter values, users want to know the patterns for each combination. This makes them to identify parameter sets that lead to particular patterns or behaviors, such as stability, oscillations, or spatial complexity.


Use cases 
1. Input Parameters: The user enters parameter
2. Run Simulation: The user executes the simulation with the entered parameters.
3. Pattern Visualization: The system displays the final concentration pattern using a color-coded 2D plot, allowing users to observe the generated Turing pattern.

how users interact with the system to get the information they want

1. Starting the Simulation
Give input parameters, run simulation
2. Viewing and Analyzing Patterns
User can see the pattern in notebook output cells
3. Parameter Sweep and Comparison of Patterns
Users can define a range of parameter values to explore. Then they can see the patterns correlating with parameters.

4. Saving and Exporting Results
User can select the export format for pattern images, parameter sweep.
