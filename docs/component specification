1. Reaction-Diffusion Model
This component sets up and simulates the reaction-diffusion equations on a 2D grid. The core of the system is based on the Turing model for generating Turing patterns.


Input Data:

Parameters:
reaction_rate_constants: Dictionary with reaction rates (e.g., k1, k2, etc.).
diffusion_coefficients: Dictionary with diffusion coefficients for each species (e.g., D_A, D_B).
grid_size: Indicate the size of simulation grid（unnecessary, default = a constant）
time_steps: Integer specifying the total number of time steps for the simulation. （unnecessary, default = a constant）


2.  Pattern Visualization 
This component takes the final concentration data generated by the RDM and visualizes it as a 2D plot. It uses libraries like matplotlib to create color-coded grids that represent concentration distributions of each species, generating Turing patterns.

Input Data:
Visualization Parameters:

color_map: Color map for visualizing the concentration levels
annotation : The parts represented by different components

3.Parameter Sweep Manager (PSM)
This component handles parameter sweeps, going through multiple combinations of reaction rates and diffusion coefficients to generate different patterns.
Input Data:
Parameter Ranges: A dictionary with ranges for each parameter to sweep over, such as {'k1': (0.1, 0.5), 'D_A': (0.01, 0.1)}.

preliminary project plan

Week 1 - write the reaction-diffusion model and write the input part and output part(pattern images)
Week 2 - write the parameter sweep part
