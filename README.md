# Turing-Pattern-Simulator
This model is used for simulating Turing pattern by reaction diffusion model.

A Turing pattern is a spatially organized, stable pattern that emerges from the interaction between two or more chemical species undergoing reaction and diffusion. It was first described by Alan Turing in his 1952 paper on morphogenesis. The system typically involves an activator and an inhibitor, where:
1. Activator promotes both its own production and that of the inhibitor.
2. Inhibitor suppresses the activator's production.
3. Diffusion plays a key role: the inhibitor diffuses faster than the activator, leading to localized concentrations of the activator.
Mathematically, Turing patterns emerge when specific parameter conditions cause the homogeneous steady state of the reaction-diffusion system to become unstable, giving rise to periodic spatial patterns.

The Turing model appears in chemical reactions, in the formation and development of biological forms. Understanding the Turing model is important for understanding biomolecular interactions, biological development, the construction of self-forming systems, and systems biology.
